                     ArgumentError: :modal & :tooltip may not both be present in :options hash

                     Raised from gem file: %{file}
                     Raised from gem method: #%{method}
                     
                     To fix this error:
                     Remove `tooltip: [the tooltip]` or `modal: '%{modal}'` from your component's :options hash

                     Component Reference:
                     Invalid component: %{class_name}
                     Component options: %{options}

                     About:
                     Modal and Tooltip both utilize the data-toggle HTML data attribute. When :modal is present,
                     it will always overwrite the tooltip's data-toggle attribute causing a silent failure
                     in which the tooltip does not render (though the modal HTML does). 

          remote:  |
                     ArgumentError: :modal & remote: true may not both be present in :options hash
                     
                     Raised from gem file: %{file}
                     Raised from gem method: #%{method}

                     To fix this error:
                     Remove `remote: true` or `modal: '%{modal}'` from your component's :options hash

                     Example incorrect usage:
                     = ui.nfg :button, remote: true, modal: '%{modal}', ...

                     Component Reference:
                     Invalid component: %{class_name}
                     Component options: %{options}

                     About:
                     Components may not include both `modal: %{modal}` and `remote: true` in their options because modalable components 
                     that fire remote actions can result in undesirable modal activation behavior.

                     This tends to occur when a modal is injected into the page from a remote action, is subsequently dismissed
                     and then opened again from the same remote link.

                     The previously dismissed modal appears (because it's still on the page, and referenced in the component's HTML) 
                     and the modal is then, visibly to the user, re-animated (overwritten and re-started) by the newly injected modal from the remote ajax action.
