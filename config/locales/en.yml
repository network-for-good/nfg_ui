        modalable:
          # required keys -- :modal, :class_name, :options, :file, :method
          remote: |
                    ArgumentError: :modal & remote: true may not both be present in :options hash
                    Raise from file: %{file}
                    Raised from method: #%{method}

                    To fix this error:
                    Remove `remote: true` or `modal: '%{modal}'` from your component's :options hash

                    Component Reference:
                    Your component: %{class_name}
                    Component options: %{options}

                    About:
                    Components may not include both `modal: %{modal}` and `remote: true` in their options because modalable components 
                    that fire remote actions can result in undesirable modal activation behavior.

                    This tends to occur when a modal is injected into the page from a remote action, is subsequently dismissed
                    and then opened again from the same remote link.

                    The previously dismissed modal appears (because it's still on the page, and referenced in the component's html) 
                    and the modal is then, visibly to the user, re-animated (overwritten) by the newly injected modal from the remote ajax action.
