Note:
These views are pulled from https://github.com/network-for-good/sso_login_emails
These files are being moved here to be centralized so that Evo & DM can use these
as needed.

For now, these views must be manually rendered as partials / templates on your views
There are no ui.nfg methods available for emails at this point.

Example:
= render "nfg_ui/email/rainbow_bar"
