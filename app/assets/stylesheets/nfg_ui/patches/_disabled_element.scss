// in Bootstrap 4.1, disabled elements, such as links, do not get pointer-events: none;
// This patches that, and excludes components that have wrapping tooltips that end up with the
// .disabled class added on them, like a tooltipped, disabled dropdown-item.
.disabled:not([data-toggle='tooltip']) { pointer-events: none;  }
